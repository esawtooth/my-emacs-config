If there is text selection, uses the text selection for path.
If the path starts with “http://”, open the URL in browser.
Input path can be {relative, full path, URL}.
Path may have a trailing “:‹n›” that indicates line number. If so, jump to that line number.
If path does not have a file extension, automatically try with “.el” for elisp files.
This command is similar to `find-file-at-point' but without prompting for confirmation.
